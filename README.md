# Thena Risk Models
 
 Overview is using supervised learning to map out imperpanent loss events, based on that run randomomzed simualations and model the distribution of freqeuncy in an aggregate loss model. We will use some a specificed distribution for the frequency, and then model the severity. Find the expected loss then.
